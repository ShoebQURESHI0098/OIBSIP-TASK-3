OIBSIP tech internship Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project predicts the price of a car based on its features using various Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about different cars, including their specifications and prices.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- 🚘 **Brand & Model**  
- 🏎 **Year of Manufacture**  
- ⚙ **Engine Power (HP)**  
- 🛣 **Mileage (km/l)**  
- ⛽ **Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/Electric/Hybrid)**  
- 🔄 **Transmission Type (Manual/Automatic)**  
- 💰 **Selling Price (Target Variable)**  

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy  
- 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- 🔢 Jupyter Notebook  

## 🏗️ Machine Learning Models Used
- ✅ Linear Regression  
- ✅ Decision Tree Regressor  
- ✅ Random Forest Regressor  
- ✅ XGBoost Regressor  

## 📌 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand feature distributions and relationships.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Convert categorical variables, normalize numeric values.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation:** Train different models and compare performance using RMSE and R² score.  
5. **Prediction & Deployment:** Use the best model for real-time car price predictions.
